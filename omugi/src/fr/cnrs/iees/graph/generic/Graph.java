 *  OMUGI is an API to implement graphs, as described by graph theory,    *
 *  but also as more commonly used in computing - e.g. dynamic graphs.    *
 *  It interfaces with JGraphT, an API for mathematical graphs, and       *
 *  GraphStream, an API for visual graphs.                                *
